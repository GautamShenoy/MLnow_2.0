Getting the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing an *.ipynb 

Solution : 
           Open : https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
           Paste the link to your notebook e.g. (https://github.com/GautamShenoy/MLnow_2.0/blob/main/UnivariateLinearRegression/UnivarLinReg.ipynb) 

           If some notebook rendered in nbviewer appears different from rendered in github, then append "?flush_cache=true" to the end of the nbviewer version url to force it to rerender.
